## How to use the program:
- [ ] Clone [the github repository](https://github.com/Chris59-create/ocr_python_projet4.git) locally
- [ ] Install the packages according the configuration file `$ pip install -r requirements.txt`.
- [ ] Run in the directory `tournoisechecs` `$ python tournois_echecs.py`.

## How to check the PEP8 compliance:
- [ ] `requirements.txt` will allow you to install the package flake8 and one of its plugin flake8-html. The chosen version of flake8 is not the last one but insure the compatibility between the two packages.
- [ ] Run in the root directory of the projet `$ flake8 --format=html --htmldir=flake-report`.
- [ ] A report of the PEP8 violations detected in the projects files will be displayed on the console .
- [ ] In the root directory a `tox.init' file contains the parameters chosen for this PEP8 check (for example, line length : 119).
- [ ] The previous command line creates a directory `flake-report` in the root directory of the project.
- [ ] Run from the root directory of the project `$ open flake-report/index.html` to access with your navigator to the html reports stored in the directory `flake-report`.
